## 🛠 Basic Features

Here are some things maxtui can do for you:

- **Create menus** to select options by typing or arrow keys.
- **Display live-updating dashboards** with animations.
- **Handle multiple inputs at once smoothly** so your app stays fast.
- **Style text and backgrounds with colors and fonts** to keep things clear.
- **Support clickable elements** where your mouse can interact in the terminal.

## 🧑‍💻 How maxtui Works (Simple Terms)

maxtui programs run inside your terminal window instead of a regular app window. They redraw the screen many times a second to show new information or effects without leaving the terminal.

This makes maxtui very lightweight compared to traditional programs. It also lets you control the app by keyboard or mouse without extra mouse drivers or apps.

Rust, the language behind maxtui, helps keep the program safe and fast.

## 🔧 Installing maxtui Programs (Optional)

If you want to install maxtui programs so you can run them from anywhere on your computer:

- On **Windows**, move the `.exe` file to a folder listed in your PATH (e.g., `C:\Windows`).
- On **Mac/Linux**, you can move the file to `/usr/local/bin` or another folder in your PATH.

This step is optional and mostly for users who want to run maxtui programs often without re-downloading.

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

If you have trouble running maxtui:

- Make sure your terminal is updated.
- Allow permission to run downloaded files.
- If the app closes immediately, try opening the terminal manually and running the file inside it.
- Restart your computer if things don’t work at first.
